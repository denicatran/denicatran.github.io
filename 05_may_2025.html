        <h5>05/03/25: my prom!</h5>
        <p>i did not really gaf about my prom atp i think i was really tired that entire week, BUT we got to spend so
            much time together week of and it made me really happy! very very sidenote: my hair was so much better at my
            prom but i did NOT lock in on my makeup like girl put any lippie on, but it was fire. i really liked taking
            goofy ahh photos with you and i really liked how you met a lot of my friends, it was lowkey a crazy
            crossover in my mind at the time, but i think being surrounded by all the people i love, including you, was
            just really nice! 10/10 would never do again but i'm glad we did go!</p>

        <h5>05/25/25: my grad party/birthday party!</h5>
        <p>this was another crazy crossover imo lit everyone that i routinely talked to at the time in one house... yo
            so if you couldn't tell i was so overstimulated this entire day and i was like deadass js tweaking the
            entire time, but you're such a comforting presence you made things better and i'm really glad you came to
            spend time w me and my friends!</p>
        <img src="media/may/IMG_0763.JPG" width="300">
        <p>lowkey... i really hate my side profile, but i like this picture a lot because i know i'm just looking into your eyes in our silly goofy ahh stance and i think it's really cute!</p>
        <img src="media/may/IMG_0765.JPG" width="300">
        <p>this is soso cute too! i wish the grad stuff wasn't there, but we look soooooooo tuff. i really love your smile in this; i feel like for a lot of people, they have different smiles like candidly and on camera, but i feel like this picture really captures your essence... and whatnot...?</p>
