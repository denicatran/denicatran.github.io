        <h3>july 2025</h3>
        <h5>07//02/25</h5>
        <p>i was in japan for the first like a lot of july so i thought i'd include pictues of some deer. i think it's
            the same deer but the top deer is you and the bottom deer is me staring at you</p>

        <p>picnic pt. 2! this was so fun i loved making my birthday legos well after two months after my birthday with
            you. idk why like maybe it was because i had just gotten back from japan or what but what i remember really
            distinctly about this picnic was that you were just so there idk how to describe that feeling but when
            everything else in the world feels like it might fall away there are moments where you're the only thing
            present and i truly believe that you won't fall away, all to say i just really wanted to hold you all day.
            also this vlog was so so cute</p>

        <p>LAKE CLEMENTINEEEEE twas so fun i think i was having like a dogshit week but it was so fun to
            nature and touch grass with you! the bridge, the damn, the trees, the lake, and everything was just so
            pretty. i also remember about this was that like i think we basically held hands for half of the hike and it
            was just really nice to be alone so close to you for so long</p>

        <p>these pictures are so cutesy your straightfacing so well and there's just something so beautiful about your
            expressionless face</p>

        <img src="media/july/IMG_1129.JPG" width="300">
        <p>okay this is very specific and strange i promise im not insane but this picture is so perfect on so many
            levels. the break between the lake and the dirt and the contrast of the rocks scattered around with the
            slight ripples of the water. our shadows also look so cutesy i love the way there's barely any light gap
            between us, i love the way you're peace signing and the way your left shoulder is so slightly raised
            everything is just so cute about this picture!</p>
